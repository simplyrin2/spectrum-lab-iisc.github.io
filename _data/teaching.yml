- title: "Dimension Reduction: Theory and Applications to Image Processing"
  description: "This course provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing complex data by combining linear algebra with statistical theory. It begins by establishing the mathematical foundations of breaking down matrices into simpler, interpretable components using techniques like Spectral Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The curriculum then connects these algebraic concepts to probability, explaining how to measure relationships between variables using covariance and how to geometrically project data onto different subspaces. The core focus of the course is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a method used to simplify large datasets by identifying the dominant patterns that explain the most variation. The course also covers applications of PCA in image processing"
  instructor: "Prof. S. Lakshmivarahan"
  instructor_bio: "After completing his PhD from the Indian Institute of Science in 1973, S. Lakshmivarahan held faculty and post-doctoral positions at the IIT-Madras, Brown and Yale Universities through 1978. In the Fall of 1978, he joined the School of Computer Science, University of Oklahoma (OU) where he held the position of George Lynn Cross Research Professor since 1995. His research interests are in Applied Mathematics and Computation and includes Data Mining and Analytics, Data Assimilation, Computational Finance, Parallel Computation and Learning Algorithms. He is an author/coauthor of six books in these areas. He was elected as a Fellow of the IEEE in 1993 and a Fellow of ACM in 1995. He has held short-term visiting positions in Japan, China, Taiwan, Thailand, India, Germany, England, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and USA. Since July 2019, he holds the position of George Lynn Cross Research Professor Emeritus at the School of Computer Science, OU."
