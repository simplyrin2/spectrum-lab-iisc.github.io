biography_paragraphs:
  - "Subhadip Mukherjee is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. His research interests lie at the intersection of signal processing, machine learning, optimization, and inverse problems, with a particular focus on medical image reconstruction and analysis. His work aims to develop robust, self-supervised, and theoretically grounded learning algorithms for imaging applications, especially in applications such as low-dose X-ray computed tomography."
  - "Dr. Mukherjee's research spans diffusion models for inverse problems, data-driven regularization, bilevel optimization, and learning-to-optimize methods, with an emphasis on robustness to noise, distribution shifts, and limited supervision. A central theme of his work is bridging the gap between proof-of-concept machine learning models and deployable clinical systems, combining algorithmic innovation with theoretical guarantees."
  - "Prior to joining IIT Kharagpur, he was an Assistant Professor at the University of Bath, UK, and held a postdoctoral position at the University of Cambridge, where he worked on learning-based approaches for imaging inverse problems and observed firsthand the challenges of translating advanced algorithms into real clinical workflows. He has taught undergraduate and graduate courses in signal processing, optimization, and mathematical foundations of machine learning, and actively supervises research projects at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels."
